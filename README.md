This repository contains a collection of Python scripts and projects that were created during a Python course. The scripts cover topics such as input/output, operators, strings, loops, data structures, functions, and error handling. There are also some examples of using Python to interact with web APIs, including weather and stock market data, as well as social media platforms such as Twitter.

Additionally, there are some exercises related to using regular expressions and working with movie data through an API. The repository also contains some examples of object-oriented programming and using Python to interact with databases.

Some of the scripts were created as part of a practice course with Solyd Offensive Security, along with [@guilhermej](https://github.com/guilhermej) and [@jamesgsilva](https://github.com/jamesgsilva).

This repository serves as a showcase of basic Python concepts and their practical applications.
